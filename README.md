## Recommendations
**Seasonal Promotions via effective Marketing Channels**
-	Capitalize on Christmas holiday season sales spikes by **offering targeted post-holiday sales, discounts or bundle deals** to encourage continued consumer spending and engagement **to curb post-holiday slump**. **Promote offers aggressively** with an emphasis on **direct, email and affiliate marketing channels**.
-	Leverage steady increase in sales and experiment with different promotional strategies during the summer months by **offering summer themed promotional sales, limited-time flash sales or summer-long discounts or product bundles** such as portable chargers, headphones, and gaming monitors to maximize engagement and sales.

**More exclusive offers and benefits for loyalty program members**
-	Offer **lower shipping costs and expedited delivery times for loyalty program members** possibly through reaching a purchase goal or through a subscription service for stabler recurring revenue.
-	Offer **more frequent exclusive promotions, product bundles, or enhanced customer support** to drive loyalty customer engagement with emphasis on direct and email marketing channels.
-	Use **customer segmentation and personalization to deliver tailored offers and experiences** that resonate with different customer groups.

**Tweak Product offerings**
-	Since Apple Airpods and lightweight laptops generate majority of revenue while the Samsung charging pack generates high order counts, **consider expanding the product catalog with products in a similar class** such as other lightweight laptop brands 
-	Consider **removing Bose Soundsport Headphones from product mix and investigate reasons for their low popularity** among customers. A possible reason might include the seamless integration of Apple Airpods Headphones with other Apple products that is already popular with Elist customers.
-	**Further research and identify the needs of various customer segments** to optimize product offerings and possibly expand product catalog. **Identifying complementary or emerging product categories and expanding product mix** will help balance out seasonal fluctuations, reduce reliance on Apple-focused products and provide a more diversified revenue stream.
