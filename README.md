From 2019 to 2022, Elist processed over 100K orders, generating more than $28 million in total revenue with an average order value (AOV) of $260. Notably, sales revenue skyrocketed by $6.2 million (a 162% growth rate) between 2019 and 2020, driven largely by the COVID-19 pandemic, peaking at $10.2 million in revenue and an AOV of $300. However, this upward trajectory began to wane, with revenue slightly declining to $9.1 million in 2021.

By 2022, revenue plummeted to $5 million, reflecting a -46% growth rate and nearly reverting to 2019 levels of $3.8 million. This downturn mirrors the trends seen in average order value throughout this period.

The decline in 2022 could be attributed to the easing of COVID restrictions, resulting in reduced screen time and subsequently lower sales. Alternatively, it may indicate a need to refresh our product offerings, warranting further investigation. Moving forward, the challenge lies in identifying strategies to regain the momentum captured during the peak years of 2020 and 2021, which will be crucial for our long-term growth trajectory.

Analyzing the monthly sales trends from 2019 to 2022 reveals some interesting patterns. From February to May, the monthly growth rates remain relatively steady albeit with slight fluctuations. However, June typically sees a slight dip, averaging -9% across the years.
During the summer months (July to September), there is a consistent increase in sales, with September peaking at an average growth rate of 12.25%. Following this peak, October experiences a significant decline, with an average drop of -31%, which is the most pronounced decrease across all months.
Sales usually bounce back significantly in December, often matching or exceeding September's peak, with an average growth rate of 21%. However, this growth is short-lived, as January sees a substantial drop, averaging -8%, indicating a sharp decline in sales right after the holiday season. This pattern reflects a common post-holiday slump in consumer spending.

## Loyalty Program

Of the first 2 years between 2019 - 2022, sales revenue accounting for non-loyalty members far exceeded the sales revenue, AOV, and order count of loyalty members, exceeding approximately $3 million in sales revenue, $25 in AOV, 12800 in order count for 2019 and $4 million in sales revenue, $117 in AOV, 7800 in order count during the pandemic boom. 

However, by 2021 – 2022, sales revenue, AOV and order count driven by loyalty members have caught up if not surpassed those who are non-loyalty members. For example, sales revenue was about $500k higher and order count was about 3000 more, despite a $10 AOV difference in 2021. In 2022, sales revenue was about $480k higher, order count was 650 more, and AOV was $31 more. Moreover, loyalty members make up approximately 42.2% of all customers.

Despite non-loyalty members generating higher total sales revenue each year, loyalty members consistently exhibit a higher average order value (AOV) across all products. Popular items among loyalty members, such as Apple AirPods, Bose SoundSport headphones, and Samsung webcams, contribute to their increased total sales revenue and order count. This suggests that loyalty members are more engaged and willing to spend, highlighting an opportunity to enhance loyalty programs and target these high-value customers more effectively.

Digging deeper into the total sales revenue and AOV by loyalty membership. Both metrics perform better for non-loyalty customers than loyalty customers within the first 2 years and 1-2 quarters into 2021. After that, the sales revenue of loyalty members surpasses that of non-loyalty members in Q2 of 2021, and AOV does the same in Q3 of 2021. However, by Q4 of 2022 loyalty member’s sales revenue and AOV dips back to being below that of non-loyalty members.

Looking into the duration between the time it took for these two types of users to make their first purchase after creating an account, loyalty customers take almost 30% less time to make a purchase, with 1.6 months after account creations as opposed to 2.3 months for non-loyaty customers

Across all years, products such as the gaming monitor, Apple Airpods and Macbook Air was responsible for 85% of the absolute total sales revenue. While the iPhone had relatively high AOV, since it accounted for 0.3% of all orders it was unable to generate significant amounts of sales revenue due to the low demand for it. On the contrary, although the Charging Cable Pack accounted for 20.3% of all orders, the product was also unable to generate significant amounts of sales revenue due to its low price despite high sales volume.
